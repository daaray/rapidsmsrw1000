To Move RapidSMS-Rwanda  from old rapidsms to new the current rapidsms (rapidsms==0.10.0 and django.1.4.2) 

Keep points:

***All the card logic is rewritten following the new rapidsms KeywordHandler style
***All the apps forked from the old rapidsms contrib apps are replaced and/or adapted to  the new rapidsms.0.10.0 philosophy
***we are using the kannel-fake-sms to test the flow incoming/outgoing messages, but still rely on kannel backend too much in our production
***still using the default recent router (BlockingRouter)
***Mention the structure is the same as the New rapidsms project templates
***All apps was modified to move to meet the new template

Procedure to setup rapidsmsrw1000 running :

TODO ....coming soon
